When people (that don't work in sales) say **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence, what they usually refer to is some piece of code that behaves intelligently. 

> [!example] Opinion
> We all have our own standards of what makes things seem intelligent. I can call my dog intelligent for bringing me the ball, while I can also doubt peoples intelligence based on how they drive in traffic. 
> 
> If I were to be objective, I would say that as long as something or someone takes "the good action" on multiple instances and is consistent, I think it's safe to say that that thing is "intelligent". 

Thus, an AI can be anything from:
* the software that can identify me in a crowd given a single picture of my face
* or a chat bot that can answer like a human when don't want to search for information
* but also an insanely difficult bot for the video game [Starcraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft)
