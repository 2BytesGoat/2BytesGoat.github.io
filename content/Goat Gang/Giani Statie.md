# Things I'm proud about

## ‚å®Ô∏è Re-designed a 5000+ line codebase

**In 2022** me and a colleague had the task to re-write a giant Java [monolith application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application) into Python microservices. My colleague knew Java, I knew Python and we made it 4 times faster, made the app easier to scale and upgrade, and reduced monthly costs from 2000$ to around 100$. Did I mention we did it in just 5 months? 

## üì¨ My first blogpost

**In 2022** I made my first public [technical blogpost](https://heits.digital/articles/gpt3-overview). It may not seem like much, but it gave me the confidence boost to create this website. It is also the most clicked blogpost on the HEITS website (as of 2024).

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è [Speedrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedrunning) - Publish a patent in the first 5 months

**In 2021** after changing jobs and being employed for only a few months, I saw the need for more synthetic data, this time generated by a [GAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) (that's like the grandfather of [Deep Fakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake)). Seeing how fast Generative Networks progressed, I rushed to patent the idea before leaving the company.

## üìÉ Publishing my first ever patent

**In 2020** while working at Porsche, we came up with a cool idea to easily create [synthetic data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_data) from real-life recordings to help us better train Machine Learning models. So we said why not, and [patented the idea](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2022033652A1/en?inventor=statie+giani&patents=false&oq=inventor:(statie+giani)).

## üèéÔ∏è Driving a real car using my own ML model

**Around 2018** while working at Porsche Engineering Cluj, I've managed to deploy a Machine Learning based [Adaptive Cruise Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_cruise_control) on a real Porsche car. The controller read the signals from the [Flexray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FlexRay#:~:text=FlexRay%20is%20a%20communication%20bus,triggered%20and%20time%2Dtriggered%20communications.) and [CAN busses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus) and overwrote the original ACC outputs with the outputs of a Neural Network. The network was trained from scratch, first through [Supervised Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) and [Reinforcement Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning).

## üêç Using a spinning blade as a game display 

**In 2017** me and a friend made the jankiest [Persistence of Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_of_vision) display for the [Digilent Design Contest](https://digilent.com/blog/digilent-design-contest-2017-finals-and-winners/). It was powered by an FPGA and you could play [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) on it. The POV was made from a CPU fan, a plastic bowl and 3D printed propeller (that we balanced using fishing weights). We got 4th place, but we felt like absolute legends.
